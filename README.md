Wine is getting more and more popular around the world and it is enjoyed by people in different regions. Wine certification and quality assessment is a key element in wine industry. Usually, wine products are assessed by physicochemical and sensory tests. Physicochemical tests, made in laboratory, are used to characterize wine properties such as density, alcohol, and PH values. Sensory tests are made by human experts to evaluate the quality of the wine.

To classify the quality of wine, various machine learning algorithms have been implemented and there performance have been validated through cross-validation.
Algorithms implemented: Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, KNN, tree / tree pruning, SVM, Random Forests with bagging and boosting.
